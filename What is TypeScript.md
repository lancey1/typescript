<!-- What is TypeScript?
In this lesson, we will start by understanding what TypeScript is and understand its usage today.

JavaScript that scales
TypeScript is built and maintained by Microsoft. Microsoft's strapline for TypeScript is JavaScript that scales because it helps write large JavaScript based programs.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. Any feature in JavaScript is available in TypeScript. TypeScript adds a powerful type system to the JavaScript we already know and love. This type system enables code editors to provide code refactoring and navigation features along with type checking. TypeScript helps a JavaScript codebase become more readable and easier to maintain by adding a static type system. -->
